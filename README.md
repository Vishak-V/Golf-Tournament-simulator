# Golf Performance Simulator

## Project Overview

The Golf Performance Simulator is a Python-based tool designed to simulate and predict golf player performances on various courses based on historical data. Utilizing statistical models and player past performances, this simulator can forecast the outcome of golf matches, including head-to-head simulations between any two players. Whether you're a golf enthusiast, a data scientist, or someone interested in sports analytics, this project offers insightful predictions and simulations that bring a data-driven approach to understanding golf performances.

## Features

- **Performance Prediction**: Predict how golfers will perform on different courses, considering their past data and course characteristics.
- **Head-to-Head Simulation**: Simulate a match between any two golfers to predict the outcome based on historical performances and statistical analysis.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset of golf player performances and course details to provide accurate simulations and predictions.
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured in a modular fashion, allowing for easy expansion, modification, and integration with other tools or datasets.
